## Code Structure
The main code that runs our ReCom algorithm is inside the `recom_function` folder. Within that folder, the main script is `recomb.m`. Run that and it should eventually start generating and saving random district maps. There are three figures that should pop up after about a minute of runtime, representing the different steps in the algorithm.
